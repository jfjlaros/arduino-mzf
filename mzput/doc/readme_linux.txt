First of all let me give you some advise before using this program.
- Sync your harddisk before using the program.
This is wise to do because mzput has total disrespect for the operating system 
and things could go wrong.

Basic setup:
- See mzput.ps page 5 for the cable and jumper plug.
- Use mzput with an mzf file as argument.

Connecting a tape recorder to your PC:
- See mzput.ps page 6 for the cable.
- Use mzput -c with an mzf file as argument.

You may use the -d option to have more control over what's going on.

Mzput by Jeroen F. J. Laros.

This program transfers MZF images from PC to MZ over the parallel port at 
high speed.

If you don't own an MZ-711 or MZ-811, read the mzput.ps document to enable
the external read and write ports of your MZ.

The cable must be wired as follows: 
PC  -  MZ
1   -  read
15  -  write
18  -  ground

You can find the executable in src/linux/ or in src\w32.

Run mzput without arguments to get a brief description of its options.

For more information please read mzput.ps.

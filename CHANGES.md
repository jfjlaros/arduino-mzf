# Changes

## Version 0.1 beta
- The ability to abort the transfer by pressing ESC.
- The motor control.
- The "can't release I/O privelege" message is gone (in normal operation, so it
  can't be safely ignored anymore).
- The option `-d` to print out more info and asks the user to press ENTER
  before beginning the transfer.
- A readme for each version (and a word of caution for windows).
- The documentation is also updated.
- The code is now tested for windows XP.

Introdcution
============

This project builds upon the MZF2WAV_ utility, which is used to convert an MZF
image to a file that can be recorded on a cassette. Since cassettes are getting
outdated rapidly, and because ordinary sound cards can not be used for speeds
exceeding twice that of the normal transfer speed, the parallel port is used
for this project instead.

The *turbo loader* is from the related to the DOS utility TransManager_.

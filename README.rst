This document covers a simple data cable and the software to transfer MZF
images from a PC directly to an MZ. Alternatively, the PC can be connected to
the data recorder of the MZ, a C64 datasette or other data recorders to
transfer MZF images to cassette.

The software is tested on Linux and Windows (NT4, W2k, XP) systems.

Please see ReadTheDocs_ for the latest documentation.
